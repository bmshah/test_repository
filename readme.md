This project is about price prediction of cars using Toyota corolla dataset.
In this academic project, different machine learning models like multiple linear regression, K-nearest neighbours (KNN) and Support vector machines (SVM) were applied to predict prices of toyota corolla cars.

Apart from price prediction, all three models were compared with each other to decide an appropriate model for prediction.
